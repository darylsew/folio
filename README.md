What it is:  
-----------
Folio is a streamlined portfolio builder created to help job seekers present themselves effectively to prospective employers.  

Resources & Dependencies:
------------------------
*   Github API for code integration  
*   Soundcloud for music integration
*   Deviantart/flickr for art integration
*   Youtube for video integration
*   Ravelry for yarn/pattern integration

Current Features
----------------
*   ![Front page design](http://i1322.photobucket.com/albums/u568/Daryl_LikeaBoshkosh/ScreenShot2013-03-25at105308PM1_zpsb15aa15b.png) (courtesy of Peter)
*   Simple database functions  
*   Login functions are functional

Features To Be Implemented
--------------------------

###Frontend  (Peter & Elizabeth) 
*   View folio  
*   Ready-made templates
*   Edit folio  
*   Add project  
*   Upload resume  
*   Allow users to tag projects/bits of information according to the resume they want them to appear in, as well as weight them so they appear in the desired order (i.e. #net: 1, #sysadmin: 7)  
*   Allow users to link to content from other sites   
*   Many more

###Backend  (Sarah & Daryl)
*   Server login stuff + session
*   Forgotten password server stuff (probably not feasible, leave it for later if there's time)
*   MongoDB: Storing users' folios (mostly done, will be edited as frontend comes along)

Deadlines
---------

*    4/1: MongoDB code for storing folios functional.  COMPLETE
*    4/5: Login page should be functional for multiple users concurrently accessing folio. MOSTLY COMPLETE (authentication not done)
*    4/7: Users should be able to view and edit folio at a basic level. UNFINISHED
*    4/12: A few ready-made templates created (pushed back from 4/5). Editing folios allows for addition of projects and uploading of resumes. UNFINISHED (those-who-shall-remain-unamed have contracted senioritis, unfortunately)
*    4/21: Integration with other sites worked out.
*    4/24: Visual designs added to site and folios; more ready-made templates created.  
*    4/28: Project deployed; testing. Peter and Daryl are out of the picture for the next 4 days so Sarah and Elizabeth will deal with debugging.
*    4/30: Folio is polished; final issues are being worked out.  
*    5/1: Project due date  

(Please note that schedules may become impacted by pending college visits and other things. Thank you.)

Individual Task Distribution
----------------------------
These will change as the project progresses. Feel free to modify anything. 
*   Peter will lead frontend work.
*   Sarah will lead backend work.
*   Peter and Elizabeth are to finalize the UI design, paper prototyping everything and beginning to work on the html pages. Once a solid UI design is in place, there will be many more tasks here.  
*   Sarah will write the server code for the login page, implementing session for login (and etc)
*   Daryl will plan out visual effect templates for use towards the end of the project, delegate and coordinate work, and perform general bugfixes/pitch in wherever he sees fit.
*   Team leader is unfilled. It is not Daryl unless a vote is performed. Awaiting Peter's return to teh internetz to determine overall team leader.

Branch Workflow/Github Use
--------------------------
Not quite established yet but have a [Git Cheat Sheet](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png). Obviously write detailed commit messages.

Everyone will probably work on their own branches, merging when necessary and using pull requests to meddle with master.
