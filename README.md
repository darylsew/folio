We want to create an application that will help job seekers present themselves effectively to prospective employers. 

music, art, writing, photography- soundcloud+deviantart+flickr (github api for repositories) make pretty, attach resume (work with document uploading? or copypasta).
*     specifics: hosting individual pages/resumes by subject --> edit and view modes, ready-made templates and possibly fully customizable ones
*     tag projects / info by which resume you want it to appear in and weigh them (low to high) so that blurbs appear in the order you want (eg: #net: 1, #sysadmin: 7)
*     let people link content from other sites (see above)


We'd like to have most of the db stuff done by this Friday. By next Friday, the backend stuff should be well on its way and the frontend should be coming along.
