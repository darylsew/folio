We want to create an application that will help job seekers present themselves effectively to prospective employers. 

music, art, writing, photography- soundcloud+deviantart+flickr (github api for repositories) make pretty, attach resume (work with document uploading? or copypasta).
*     specifics: hosting individual pages/resumes by subject --> edit and view modes, ready-made templates and possibly fully customizable ones
*     tag projects / info by which resume you want it to appear in and weigh them (low to high) so that blurbs appear in the order you want (eg: #net: 1, #sysadmin: 7)
*     let people link content from other sites (see above)
